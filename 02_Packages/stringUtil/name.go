package stringUtil

var MyName = "BPCizzle" //if the variable name begins with upper case, it can be called by a package/function in another folder.
//var myname = "BPC" //if the var name begins with lower case, it can only be called from another package/function within the same folder.
//var MyName = string "BPCizzle"  //just another way to declare variables, lots of ways to do the same thing.
